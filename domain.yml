  utter_corona_intro:
  - text: Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals
      or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory
      infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle
      East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).
      The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.
  utter_corona_spread:
  - text: People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can
      spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which
      are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land
      on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19
      by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
      People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with
      COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to
      stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.
  utter_food_spread:
  - text: 'There is currently no evidence that people can catch COVID-19 from food
      or food packaging. COVID-19 is a respiratory illness and the transmission route
      is through person-to-person contact and through direct contact with respiratory
      droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes. '
  utter_weather_effect:
  - text: You can catch COVID-19, no matter how sunny or hot the weather is. Countries
      with hot weather have reported cases of COVID-19. To protect yourself, make
      sure you clean your hands frequently and thoroughly and avoid touching your
      eyes, mouth, and nose.
  utter_risk:
  - text: While we are still learning about how COVID-2019 affects people, older persons
      and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure,
      heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes)  appear to develop serious
      illness more often than others.
